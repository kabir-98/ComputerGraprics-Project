# ComputerGraprics-Project
This is a 3D-FPP based project.
You can see all the drawings using arrow keys.
Day-Night conversion, moving objects etc.
Added actual image on this project by texture mapping.
This project works fine on both Linux and Windows OS.
To see the actual work like texture mapping please use Linux OS as this Texture mapping is not properly optimized on Windows
